# phpSimpleDataEntery
Simple Data Entry App written in PHP 

Wrote this code when I was learning PHP. This is a simple example of data entry program using PHP and includes the functionality of user registration. If I can recall correctly Apache logs showed some warning about creating SESSIONS so this code has bugs. Although the app works completely fine. 

.sql backup is included.
